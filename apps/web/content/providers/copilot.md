GitHub Copilot is tracked through **OpenCode**: AI Status reads the Copilot token that OpenCode stores when you authenticate it, then calls GitHub's Copilot API for your usage. So the setup is really "authenticate Copilot inside OpenCode once."

## Requirements

- **OpenCode** installed, authenticated with GitHub Copilot
- `jq` and `curl` (already required by AI Status)

## Step 1 — Authenticate Copilot in OpenCode

Run OpenCode's auth flow and pick **GitHub Copilot**:

```bash
opencode auth login
```

Complete the GitHub sign-in. OpenCode saves the token under the `github-copilot` key in:

```
~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json
```

AI Status reads `["github-copilot"].access` from that file.

## Step 2 — Enable it in AI Status

Right-click the AI Status module to open the config TUI, make sure **Copilot** is enabled, then left-click to refresh.

## What it tracks

Your Copilot chat and completions usage, with remaining counts.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Shows nothing / `{}` | No `github-copilot` token in OpenCode — run `opencode auth login` and pick GitHub Copilot. |
| Was working, now blank | Re-authenticate Copilot in OpenCode to refresh the token. |
| Confirm the token exists | `jq '."github-copilot"' ~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json` |

Run the provider's fetch script by hand to see the raw response:

```bash
bash ~/.local/share/ai-status/packages/lib/src/providers/copilot/query.sh
```
